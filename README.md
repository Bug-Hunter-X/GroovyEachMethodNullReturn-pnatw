This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior of Groovy's each method. The each method iterates over a collection and applies a closure to each element. However, the each method itself returns null. This can lead to unexpected results if the return value of each is used in further operations. The example in bug.groovy shows that when you try to print the result of each, you get null instead of the expected list with doubled values. The bugSolution.groovy file provides a solution using the collect method which does return the transformed list.
